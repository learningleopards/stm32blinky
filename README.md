- 🌱 **Task description:-** 

Firstly, we installed the STM32CubeIDE and configured the board which is NUCLEO-F446RE. The IDE of STMCubeIDE with integrated STM32CubeMX is choosen to install the STM32CubeIDE. The STM32CubeIDE is installed based on the the lecture note of Chapter 4 (Cortex-M4 Overview) and also a Youtube video. The same video is referred for the LED blinking. Below is the snippet of the LED blinking code where we blink the LED on STM32 board for 1 second and off LED for 1 second repeatedly.

The code is saved and we built the project. Once the compilation is done with 0 error, we uploaded the code into the board (NUCLEO-F446RE) and the LED on the board began to blink 1 second and off for 1 second.
